# DSCI-235-Project

Baseball is known for its plethora of data to be analyzed within the game. At the center of that is Statcast. A tracking system that collects data on several data points during a Major League Baseball game. The data set I chose for this project is a publically accessable Statcast data set from every pitch during April of the 2021 MLB season. The data include over 100,000 rows with over 35 variables describing the data. These variabes range from how fast each pitch was thrown to how fast the ball was hit off the bat, if it was hit on that pitch. The reason I chose only April was to create a smaller sample size tp analyze but still have a large sample size to look at. A description of all variables I will use can be found at: https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs

------
Questions I intend to answer with this data set.
1. Which team has the highest/lowest average fastball pitch speed from their pitchers?
2. Which team has the highest/lowest average hit speed from their hitters?
3. Which team has "unluckiest" hitters? 
4. Do right handed or left handed batters get shifted upon more often? 
5. Do teams tend to score more runs while playing at home or away?
