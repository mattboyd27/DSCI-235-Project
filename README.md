# DSCI-235-Project

Baseball is known for its plethora of data to be analyzed within the game. At the center of that is Statcast. A tracking system that collects data on several data points during a Major League Baseball game. The data set I chose for this project is a publically accessable Statcast data set from every pitch during the 2021 season. The data include over 700,000 rows with over 93 variables describing the data. These variabes range from how fast each pitch was thrown to how fast the ball was hit off the bat, if it was hit on that pitch.
